# mkpeer

A script to be run by hand or from Ansible to automagically give you router config for peering requests.

`./mkpeer.py <peer_asn>`

Make sure to have `$PEERINGDB_USERNAME` and `$PEERINGDB_PASSWORD` set in your environment.

Output is hard coded to junos set commands right now.

### TODO

 - [ ] Figure out a way to only output the IXPs you are interested in.
       use a yaml dict to lookup ASNs in bulk, and match against a region or IXP?
 - [ ] Specify ASNs in bulk.
 - [ ] Switch for cli use vs Ansbile templates (set commands vs config replace: code?)
 - [ ] Make the config idempotent (diff clean) across multiple runs. Useful for updating prefix counts.
